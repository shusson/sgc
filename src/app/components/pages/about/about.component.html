                    The Sydney Genomics Collaborative is a $24 million, four-year investment by the NSW State Government
                    in
                    using genetic technologies to improve patient outcomes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Genomics is one of the fastest-growing areas of medical research and has emerged as a highly
                    promising
                    source of new insights into the genetic cause of disease.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Sydney Genomics Collaborative program was established with NSW State Government funding in June
                    2014
                    to boost genomic research across NSW into inherited diseases and disorders with a genetic component,
                    including cancer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Collaborative utilises the Illumina HiSeq X Ten, a high-speed genome sequencing system operated
                    by
                    the Garvan Institute of Medical Research. The Illumina HiSeq X Ten technology enables the study of
                    whole-genome sequences at the scale of large populations.
                </p>

                    The Collaborative Program comprises:
